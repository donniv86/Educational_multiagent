## What is CrewAI?

**CrewAI** is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch—completely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks. It empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, ideal for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario.

### Key Differentiators
- **Independent Framework**: Built from scratch, not dependent on LangChain
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specializes in orchestrating teams of AI agents
- **Role-Based Architecture**: Agents have specific roles, goals, and responsibilities
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for production deployment with over 100,000 certified developers

## Core Concepts

### 1. Crews
Crews are the top-level organizational unit that manages AI agent teams:
- Oversees workflows and collaboration
- Ensures timely completion of objectives
- Manages resources and coordination

### 2. Agents
Specialized team members with distinct capabilities:
- **Roles**: Specific functions (researcher, writer, analyst, etc.)
- **Goals**: Clear objectives for each agent
- **Backstories**: Context that shapes agent behavior
- **Tools**: Capabilities and integrations available to each agent

### 3. Tasks
Individual assignments with clear objectives:
- Specific deliverables and outcomes
- Assigned tools and resources
- Feed into larger processes
- Produce actionable results

### 4. Processes
Workflow management systems:
- Define collaboration patterns
- Control task assignments
- Manage agent interactions
- Ensure efficient execution

## Key Features

### CrewAI Crews
- **Autonomy Optimization**: Agents work independently within their roles
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Seamless cooperation between agents
- **Role-Based Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific expertise areas
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle simple to complex multi-agent systems

### CrewAI Flows
- **Event-Driven Control**: Granular control over task orchestration
- **Single LLM Calls**: Precise task execution with minimal overhead
- **Native Crew Support**: Integrates seamlessly with Crew systems
- **State Management**: Maintains execution context and data

### Tool Integration
- **Built-in Tools**: Extensive collection of pre-built tools
- **Custom Tools**: Easy creation of specialized capabilities
- **MCP Support**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **API Integrations**: Connect with external services and data sources

### Configuration Files

#### agents.yaml
```yaml
researcher:
  role: "Research Specialist"
  goal: "Gather comprehensive information on given topics"
  backstory: "Expert researcher with years of experience in data analysis"
  tools: ["web_search", "file_reader"]

writer:
  role: "Content Writer"
  goal: "Create engaging and informative content"
  backstory: "Seasoned writer with expertise in multiple domains"
  tools: ["text_processor", "grammar_checker"]
```

#### tasks.yaml
```yaml
research_task:
  description: "Conduct thorough research on the specified topic"
  agent: "researcher"
  expected_output: "Comprehensive research report"

writing_task:
  description: "Create content based on research findings"
  agent: "writer"
  expected_output: "Final content piece"
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Crew Example
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Gather and analyze relevant information",
    backstory="Expert in data analysis and research methodologies"
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Compose comprehensive articles based on research",
    backstory="Seasoned writer with a knack for clear content"
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Conduct thorough research on the given topic",
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write an article incorporating the research findings",
    agent=writer
)

# Create and run crew
content_creation_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process="sequential"
)

result = content_creation_crew.kickoff()
```

### Using Tools
```python
from crewai_tools import SerperApiTool, FileReadTool

# Create agents with tools
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research topics thoroughly",
    tools=[SerperApiTool(), FileReadTool()],
    backstory="Expert researcher"
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Tools
```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class CustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Custom Tool"
    description: str = "A custom tool for specific tasks"

    def _run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Your tool logic here
        return "Tool result"

# Using decorator approach
from crewai import tool

@tool("Quick Tool")
def quick_function(input_data):
    # Tool logic
    return processed_result
```

### MCP Integration
```python
from mcp import StdioServerParameters
from crewai_tools import MCPServerAdapter

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uvx",
    args=["--quiet", "pubmedmcp@0.1.3"],
    env={"UV_PYTHON": "3.12", **os.environ},
)

with MCPServerAdapter(server_params) as tools:
    agent = Agent(..., tools=tools)
    # Use agent with MCP tools
```

### Hierarchical Crews
```python
# Create specialized sub-crews
research_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task],
    process="sequential"
)

writing_crew = Crew(
    agents=[writer, editor],
    tasks=[writing_task, editing_task],
    process="sequential"
)

# Main crew orchestrates sub-crews
main_crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_crew, writing_crew],
    tasks=[coordination_task],
    process="hierarchical"
)
```
